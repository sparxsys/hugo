Cool.
Very good.</description>

      <description>I just finished working on my brand new Known CMS based site which is fully compliant with #IndieWeb prinicples.
So the site is this: http://www.sagar.ravi.pro/
The site supports webmentions. I also connected it to my Linkedin and Foursquare accounts. I really enjoy the feature of Checkin in Known site and that can be syndicated to my Foursquare account. Although it is not perfect as the location that was checked in on Foursquare was not 100% accurate but anyways it is a good start.</description>

      <description>I am using the Icarus theme and realized that when you do &amp;ldquo;hugo new post&amp;rdquo; command, it will generate the syntax for you for the post but it is slightly different from what hugo expects. For instance we have to use either equal to sign or colon consistently in one post. We can mix them.</description>

      <description>Just learned how to deploy the site from hugo to netlify, it will automatically build and deploy your site from your github account master branch. Amazing.</description>
