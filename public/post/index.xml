      <title>Introducing My Known Site</title>
      <link>https://hugo.ravi.pro/2018/03/29/introducing-my-known-site/</link>

      <description>I just finished working on my brand new Known CMS based site which is fully compliant with #IndieWeb prinicples.
So the site is this: http://www.sagar.ravi.pro/
The site supports webmentions. I also connected it to my Linkedin and Foursquare accounts. I really enjoy the feature of Checkin in Known site and that can be syndicated to my Foursquare account. Although it is not perfect as the location that was checked in on Foursquare was not 100% accurate but anyways it is a good start.</description>

      <description>Today I was reading about various static site generators. So far I like Hugo. Let us see how it goes. I will most likely not replace my main blog www.ravisagar.in with any static site generator anytime soon but I really like this ability to create content easily. Going good so far.
One thing is sure that I will keep this https://hugo.ravi.pro domain active.</description>

      <title>Wrong Formatting</title>
      <link>https://hugo.ravi.pro/2018/03/26/wrong-formatting/</link>

      <description>I am using the Icarus theme and realized that when you do &amp;ldquo;hugo new post&amp;rdquo; command, it will generate the syntax for you for the post but it is slightly different from what hugo expects. For instance we have to use either equal to sign or colon consistently in one post. We can mix them.</description>

      <description>Just learned how to deploy the site from hugo to netlify, it will automatically build and deploy your site from your github account master branch. Amazing.</description>
