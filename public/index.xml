      <description>Today I was reading about various static site generators. So far I like Hugo. Let us see how it goes. I will most likely not replace my main blog www.ravisagar.in with any static site generator anytime soon but I really like this ability to create content easily. Going good so far.
One thing is sure that I will keep this https://hugo.ravi.pro domain active.</description>

      <description>I am using the Icarus theme and realized that when you do &amp;ldquo;hugo new post&amp;rdquo; command, it will generate the syntax for you for the post but it is slightly different from what hugo expects. For instance we have to use either equal to sign or colon consistently in one post. We can mix them.</description>
